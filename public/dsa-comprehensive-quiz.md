## Introduction to Data Structures <!-- CH_ID: intro -->

Description: Fundamental concepts and basic data structures in computer science.

---

### Q: What is the time complexity of binary search? <!-- Q_ID: binary_search_complexity -->

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm for finding elements in a sorted array.

**Options:**
**A1:** O(n)
**A2:** O(log n)
**A3:** O(n²)
**A4:** O(n log n)

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
Binary search divides the search space in half with each comparison, resulting in $O(\log n)$ time complexity. This is because we eliminate half of the remaining elements in each step.

The recurrence relation is: $T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1)$, which solves to $O(\log n)$.

---

### Q: Which data structure follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle? <!-- Q_ID: lifo_data_structure -->

Understanding the fundamental principles of different data structures.

**Options:**
**A1:** Queue
**A2:** Stack
**A3:** Array
**A4:** Linked List

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
A **stack** follows the LIFO principle where the last element added is the first one to be removed. This is implemented using operations like `push()` and `pop()`.

Common applications include:

- Function call management
- Expression evaluation
- Undo operations in text editors

---

### T/F: A balanced binary search tree guarantees O(log n) search time. <!-- Q_ID: balanced_bst_search -->

Understanding the properties of balanced binary search trees.

**Correct:** True

**Exp:**
A balanced binary search tree (like AVL or Red-Black trees) maintains a height of $O(\log n)$, which guarantees $O(\log n)$ search, insertion, and deletion operations. This is because the tree remains approximately balanced, preventing the worst-case scenario of a linear tree.

---

## Arrays and Dynamic Arrays <!-- CH_ID: arrays -->

Description: Linear data structures and their implementations.

---

### Q: What is the amortized time complexity of inserting an element at the end of a dynamic array? <!-- Q_ID: dynamic_array_insertion -->

Dynamic arrays automatically resize when they run out of space.

**Options:**
**A1:** O(1)
**A2:** O(n)
**A3:** O(log n)
**A4:** O(1) amortized

**Correct:** A4

**Exp:**
While individual insertions can take $O(n)$ time when resizing occurs, the **amortized** time complexity is $O(1)$. This is because resizing happens infrequently (when the array doubles in size), and the cost is spread across many $O(1)$ insertions.

**Mathematical proof:**

- Resize when size reaches powers of 2: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots$
- Total cost for n insertions: $n + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \ldots + n/2 = 3n - 1$
- Amortized cost per insertion: $(3n - 1)/n = O(1)$

---

### Q: Which of the following is NOT a disadvantage of arrays? <!-- Q_ID: array_disadvantages -->

Understanding the trade-offs of using arrays.

**Options:**
**A1:** Fixed size (in static arrays)
**A2:** Random access time
**A3:** Memory waste in sparse arrays
**A4:** Difficulty in insertion/deletion

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
**Random access time** is actually an **advantage** of arrays, not a disadvantage. Arrays provide $O(1)$ random access to any element using indexing.

The actual disadvantages include:

- **Fixed size** in static arrays
- **Memory waste** when arrays are sparsely populated
- **O(n) time** for insertion/deletion in the middle

---

## Linked Lists <!-- CH_ID: linked_lists -->

Description: Linear data structures with dynamic memory allocation.

---

### Q: What is the time complexity of inserting a node at the beginning of a singly linked list? <!-- Q_ID: linked_list_insertion -->

Understanding linked list operations and their complexities.

**Options:**
**A1:** O(1)
**A2:** O(n)
**A3:** O(log n)
**A4:** O(n²)

**Correct:** A1

**Exp:**
Inserting at the beginning of a singly linked list takes $O(1)$ time because:

1. Create a new node
2. Set the new node's next pointer to the current head
3. Update the head pointer to point to the new node

No traversal is needed, making it a constant-time operation.

**Code example:**

```python
def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.next = self.head
    self.head = new_node
```

---

### Q: Which of the following is true about circular linked lists? <!-- Q_ID: circular_linked_list -->

Understanding variations of linked lists.

**Options:**
**A1:** The last node points to NULL
**A2:** The last node points to the first node
**A3:** Each node has two pointers
**A4:** They cannot be traversed completely

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
In a **circular linked list**, the last node's next pointer points back to the first node, creating a circular structure. This allows for continuous traversal and is useful in applications like:

- Round-robin scheduling
- Implementing circular buffers
- Creating circular data structures

---

## Stacks and Queues <!-- CH_ID: stacks_queues -->

Description: Linear data structures with specific access patterns.

---

### Q: What is the result of evaluating the postfix expression "3 4 + 2 \* 7 /"? <!-- Q_ID: postfix_evaluation -->

Understanding postfix notation and stack-based evaluation.

**Options:**
**A1:** 2
**A2:** 3
**A3:** 4
**A4:** 7

**Correct:** A1

**Exp:**
Let's evaluate step by step using a stack:

```
Expression: 3 4 + 2 * 7 /
Stack operations:
1. Push 3: [3]
2. Push 4: [3, 4]
3. + : Pop 4, Pop 3, Push 3+4=7: [7]
4. Push 2: [7, 2]
5. * : Pop 2, Pop 7, Push 7*2=14: [14]
6. Push 7: [14, 7]
7. / : Pop 7, Pop 14, Push 14/7=2: [2]
```

**Result: 2**

---

### T/F: A queue can be implemented using two stacks. <!-- Q_ID: queue_with_stacks -->

Understanding the relationship between different data structures.

**Correct:** True

**Exp:**
Yes, a queue can be implemented using two stacks. Here's how:

**Method 1 - Enqueue O(1), Dequeue O(n):**

- **Enqueue**: Push to stack1
- **Dequeue**: Pop all elements from stack1 to stack2, then pop from stack2

**Method 2 - Enqueue O(n), Dequeue O(1):**

- **Enqueue**: Pop all elements from stack2 to stack1, push new element to stack1, then pop all back to stack2
- **Dequeue**: Pop from stack2

---

## Trees and Binary Trees <!-- CH_ID: trees -->

Description: Hierarchical data structures and their properties.

---

### Q: What is the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h? <!-- Q_ID: binary_tree_max_nodes -->

Understanding the relationship between height and nodes in binary trees.

**Options:**
**A1:** 2^h
**A2:** 2^(h+1) - 1
**A3:** h^2
**A4:** 2h + 1

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h is $2^{h+1} - 1$.

**Proof by induction:**

- **Base case (h=0)**: $2^{0+1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$ node ✓
- **Inductive step**: Assume true for height k
- For height k+1: $1 + 2 \cdot (2^{k+1} - 1) = 1 + 2^{k+2} - 2 = 2^{k+2} - 1$ ✓

This occurs when the tree is **complete** (all levels filled except possibly the last).

---

### Q: Which traversal visits the root node between its subtrees? <!-- Q_ID: tree_traversal_types -->

Understanding different tree traversal methods.

**Options:**
**A1:** Preorder
**A2:** Inorder
**A3:** Postorder
**A4:** Level-order

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
**Inorder traversal** visits the root node between its left and right subtrees.

**Traversal order:**

- **Preorder**: Root → Left → Right
- **Inorder**: Left → Root → Right ← **This one**
- **Postorder**: Left → Right → Root
- **Level-order**: Level by level (BFS)

For a BST, inorder traversal gives elements in **sorted order**.

---

## Binary Search Trees <!-- CH_ID: bst -->

Description: Sorted binary trees with search properties.

---

### Q: What is the worst-case time complexity of searching in a BST? <!-- Q_ID: bst_search_worst_case -->

Understanding the performance characteristics of BSTs.

**Options:**
**A1:** O(log n)
**A2:** O(n)
**A3:** O(n log n)
**A4:** O(1)

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
The worst-case time complexity of searching in a BST is $O(n)$ when the tree is **unbalanced** (essentially a linked list).

**Examples of worst-case scenarios:**

- Inserting elements in sorted order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- This creates a linear tree with height n-1
- Search time becomes $O(n)$

**Balanced BSTs** (AVL, Red-Black) maintain $O(\log n)$ search time.

---

### T/F: The inorder traversal of a BST always produces a sorted sequence. <!-- Q_ID: bst_inorder_sorted -->

Understanding the fundamental property of BSTs.

**Correct:** True

**Exp:**
Yes, the inorder traversal of a BST **always** produces a sorted sequence. This is a fundamental property of BSTs.

**Why this works:**

- In a BST, all nodes in the left subtree are smaller than the root
- All nodes in the right subtree are larger than the root
- Inorder traversal: Left → Root → Right
- This naturally produces elements in ascending order

**Code example:**

```python
def inorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        inorder_traversal(root.left)   # Visit left subtree
        print(root.data)               # Visit root
        inorder_traversal(root.right)  # Visit right subtree
```

---

## Heaps and Priority Queues <!-- CH_ID: heaps -->

Description: Complete binary trees with heap property.

---

### Q: What is the time complexity of extracting the minimum element from a min-heap? <!-- Q_ID: min_heap_extract -->

Understanding heap operations and their complexities.

**Options:**
**A1:** O(1)
**A2:** O(log n)
**A3:** O(n)
**A4:** O(n log n)

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
Extracting the minimum element from a min-heap takes $O(\log n)$ time because:

1. **O(1)**: Remove the root (minimum element)
2. **O(log n)**: Move the last element to root and heapify down

**Heapify process:**

- Compare with children
- Swap with smaller child
- Repeat until heap property is restored
- Maximum comparisons = height of tree = $O(\log n)$

---

### Q: Which of the following is NOT a valid heap property? <!-- Q_ID: heap_properties -->

Understanding the fundamental properties of heaps.

**Options:**
**A1:** Parent is smaller than children (min-heap)
**A2:** Parent is larger than children (max-heap)
**A3:** All levels are completely filled
**A4:** Left child is always smaller than right child

**Correct:** A4

**Exp:**
**Left child is always smaller than right child** is NOT a heap property. Heaps only maintain the parent-child relationship, not sibling relationships.

**Valid heap properties:**

- **Min-heap**: Parent ≤ children
- **Max-heap**: Parent ≥ children
- **Complete binary tree**: All levels filled except possibly the last

**Sibling order doesn't matter** in heaps.

---

## Hash Tables <!-- CH_ID: hash_tables -->

Description: Key-value data structures with average O(1) access.

---

### Q: What is the best-case time complexity of searching in a hash table? <!-- Q_ID: hash_table_search_best -->

**Options:**
**A1:** O(1)
**A2:** O(log n)
**A3:** O(n)
**A4:** O(n²)

**Exp:**
The best-case time complexity of searching in a hash table is $O(1)$ when there are no collisions.

**Ideal scenario:**

- Perfect hash function
- No collisions
- Direct array access using hash value
- Constant time operation

**Average case**: $O(1)$ with good hash function
**Worst case**: $O(n)$ with many collisions

Understanding different methods to handle hash collisions.

**Options:**
**A1:** Linear probing
**A2:** Quadratic probing
**A3:** Double hashing
**A4:** Chaining

**Correct:** A4

**Exp:**
**Chaining** (or separate chaining) uses a linked list at each bucket to store multiple elements that hash to the same index.

**How it works:**

- Each bucket contains a linked list
- Colliding elements are added to the list
- Search: Hash to bucket, then search the list
- Insert: Hash to bucket, add to list

**Other methods:**

- **Linear probing**: Find next empty slot
- **Quadratic probing**: Use quadratic function for next slot
- **Double hashing**: Use second hash function

**Options:**
**A1:** O(V)
**A2:** O(E)
**A3:** O(V + E)
**A4:** O(V \* E)

**Correct:** A3

**Exp:**
DFS traversal on a graph takes $O(V + E)$ time where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

**Why O(V + E):**

- Visit each vertex once: $O(V)$
- Examine each edge once: $O(E)$
- Total: $O(V + E)$

**Space complexity**: $O(V)$ for recursion stack and visited array.

### Q: Which algorithm finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph? <!-- Q_ID: shortest_path_unweighted -->

Understanding shortest path algorithms for different graph types.

**Options:**
**A1:** Dijkstra's algorithm
**A2:** Bellman-Ford algorithm
**A3:** BFS
**A4:** DFS

**Correct:** A3

**Exp:**
**BFS (Breadth-First Search)** finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the first time we reach a node, we've found the shortest path.

**Why BFS works:**

- Explores nodes in order of distance from source
- First visit to a node = shortest path
- Uses queue to maintain level order

**Other algorithms:**

- **Dijkstra**: For weighted graphs with non-negative weights
- **Bellman-Ford**: For weighted graphs with negative weights

**A2:** O(2^n)
**A3:** O(n²)
**A4:** O(n log n)

**Correct:** A1

**Exp:**
The memoized Fibonacci algorithm has $O(n)$ time complexity because each subproblem is solved only once.

**Naive recursive**: $O(2^n)$ - exponential
**Memoized**: $O(n)$ - linear

**Why O(n):**

- Each Fibonacci number from 0 to n is computed exactly once
- Total number of subproblems = n + 1
- Time per subproblem = $O(1)$
- Total time = $O(n)$

---

### T/F: Dynamic programming always requires more space than the recursive solution. <!-- Q_ID: dp_space_complexity -->

Understanding the space-time trade-offs in dynamic programming.

**Correct:** False

Dynamic programming does **not** always require more space. In fact, it often uses **less space** than the recursive solution.

**Examples:**

- **Fibonacci**: Recursive $O(n)$ stack space vs DP $O(1)$ space (with optimization)
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Can be optimized to use $O(\min(m,n))$ space
- **Knapsack**: Can be optimized to use $O(W)$ space instead of $O(n \cdot W)$

**Space optimization techniques:**

- Rolling array
- Space-optimized DP
- Bottom-up with reduced dimensions

- **Quick Sort**: $O(n^2)$ worst case (when pivot is always smallest/largest)
- **Bubble Sort**: $O(n^2)$ worst case
- **Selection Sort**: $O(n^2)$ worst case

**Why Merge Sort is stable:**

- Always divides array in half
- Merge operation is $O(n)$
- Recurrence: $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) = O(n \log n)$

---

### Q: What is the space complexity of in-place Quick Sort? <!-- Q_ID: quicksort_space -->

Understanding the space requirements of sorting algorithms.

**A4:** O(n log n)

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
In-place Quick Sort has $O(\log n)$ space complexity due to the recursion stack.

**Space breakdown:**

- **In-place partitioning**: $O(1)$ extra space
- **Recursion stack**: $O(\log n)$ in average case
- **Worst case recursion stack**: $O(n)$ when pivot is always smallest/largest

**Optimization**: Use iterative approach with explicit stack to control space usage.

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
Finding LCS using dynamic programming takes $O(m \cdot n)$ time where m and n are the lengths of the two strings.

**DP approach:**

- Create 2D table of size $(m+1) \times (n+1)$
- Fill each cell in $O(1)$ time
- Total cells = $(m+1) \times (n+1) \approx m \times n$
- Time complexity = $O(m \times n)$

- **Extract Min/Max**: $O(\log n)$ - better than BST's $O(\log n)$ average
- **Peek**: $O(1)$ - better than BST's $O(\log n)$
- **Space**: $O(n)$ - same as others

**Why not others:**

- **Array**: $O(n)$ for insert/delete

The solution to $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n$ is $O(n \log n)$.

**Using Master Theorem:**

- $a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = n$
- $n^{\log_b(a)} = n^{\log_2(2)} = n^1 = n$
- $f(n) = n = \Theta(n^1) = \Theta(n^{\log_b(a)})$

Understanding practical applications of data structures.

**Options:**
**A1:** Queue
**A2:** Stack
**A3:** Array
**A4:** Hash Table

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
A **Stack** is most suitable for implementing a web browser's back button because it follows the LIFO principle.

- **Back button**: Pop URL from stack
- **Forward button**: Use a separate stack or maintain position

**Why not others:**

- **Queue**: FIFO - would go to oldest page first
- **Array**: No natural LIFO behavior
- **Hash Table**: No ordering, can't go back sequentially

Understanding the benefits of specialized data structures.

**Options:**
**A1:** Constant time insertion
**A2:** Efficient prefix searching
**A3:** Minimal memory usage
**A4:** Easy implementation

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
The primary advantage of using a Trie for autocomplete is **efficient prefix searching**.

**How Trie helps:**

- **Prefix search**: $O(m)$ where m is prefix length
- **Autocomplete**: Find all words with given prefix
- **Space efficient**: Shared prefixes reduce memory usage
- **Fast lookup**: No need to search entire dictionary

**Time complexity:**

## Algorithm Optimization <!-- CH_ID: optimization -->

Description: Techniques for improving algorithm performance.

---

### Q: What is the primary benefit of using memoization in dynamic programming? <!-- Q_ID: memoization_benefit -->

Understanding the advantages of memoization over naive recursion.

**Options:**
**A1:** Reduces space complexity
**A2:** Eliminates redundant computations
**A3:** Simplifies the algorithm
**A4:** Makes the algorithm iterative

**Correct:** A2

**Exp:**
The primary benefit of memoization is **eliminating redundant computations** by storing results of subproblems.

**How memoization works:**

- Store results of subproblems in a table/cache
- Before computing, check if result already exists
- If exists, return cached result
- If not, compute and store result

**Example - Fibonacci:**

- **Naive**: $F(5) = F(4) + F(3), F(4) = F(3) + F(2), F(3) = F(2) + F(1)$
- **Memoized**: $F(3)$ computed once, reused multiple times

---

### T/F: Space-time tradeoff always means using more space to reduce time complexity. <!-- Q_ID: space_time_tradeoff -->

Understanding the concept of space-time tradeoffs in algorithm design.

**Correct:** False

**Exp:**
Space-time tradeoff does **not** always mean using more space to reduce time. It can work in both directions:

**More space, less time:**

- Hash table: $O(n)$ space for $O(1)$ lookup
- Memoization: Store results to avoid recomputation
- Precomputed tables: Store frequently used values

**Less space, more time:**

- In-place sorting: $O(1)$ space but may be slower
- Streaming algorithms: Process data in chunks
- Space-optimized DP: Reduce space at cost of recomputation

**The tradeoff is about optimizing one resource at the expense of another.**

**Correct:** A3

**Exp:**
Finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) using dynamic programming takes $O(n^2)$ time.

**DP approach:**

- For each element, check all previous elements
- If previous element is smaller, update LIS length
- Total comparisons: $1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + (n-1) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)$

**Optimized approach:**

- Using binary search: $O(n \log n)$
- But standard DP is $O(n^2)$

**Space complexity**: $O(n)$ for the DP array

### Q: Which algorithm is most suitable for finding the shortest path in a graph with negative edge weights? <!-- Q_ID: negative_weights_shortest_path -->

Understanding the limitations and applications of different shortest path algorithms.

**Options:**
**A1:** Dijkstra's algorithm
**A2:** BFS
**A3:** Bellman-Ford algorithm
**A4:** DFS

**Correct:** A3

**Exp:**
**Bellman-Ford algorithm** is most suitable for finding shortest paths in graphs with negative edge weights.

**Why others fail:**

- **Dijkstra**: Assumes non-negative weights, fails with negative edges
- **BFS**: Only works for unweighted graphs
- **DFS**: Not designed for shortest paths

**Bellman-Ford advantages:**

- Handles negative edge weights
- Detects negative cycles
- Works with any graph structure
- Time complexity: $O(VE)$

**Limitations:**

- Slower than Dijkstra for non-negative weights
- $O(VE)$ vs $O((V+E) \log V)$
