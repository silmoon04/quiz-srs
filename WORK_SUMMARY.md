# Work Summary - 2025-10-28

## What Was Done

### ‚úÖ Completed: Partial KaTeX Sanitization Fix

**Problem:** Inline math expressions were duplicating (e.g., `O(n2)O(n^2)`) because the sanitizer was stripping KaTeX's MathML tags and CSS classes.

**Solution:**

1. Updated `lib/markdown/pipeline.ts` sanitization schema:
   - Extended `defaultSchema` from `rehype-sanitize` instead of replacing it
   - Added all KaTeX MathML tags (`math`, `semantics`, `mrow`, `mi`, `mo`, `mn`, etc.)
   - **Critical fix:** Added `className` and `style` to wildcard attributes - the default schema doesn't include these!
   - Added `aria-hidden` to spans for screen reader compatibility
2. Removed `sanitizeFallback` function that was bypassing KaTeX and causing duplicates

3. Re-enabled KaTeX test suite in `tests/unit/renderer/latex-functionality.test.tsx`

**Results:**

- ‚úÖ 4/13 tests passing (all inline math tests)
- ‚úÖ Inline math (`$x = y$`) now renders correctly
- ‚úÖ MathML structure preserved for accessibility
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Display math (`$$...$$`) still has issues (6/13 tests failing)

**Test Output:**

```
‚úÖ should render inline math correctly
‚úÖ should render multiple inline math expressions
‚úÖ should handle inline math with special characters
‚úÖ should handle inline math with fractions

‚ùå should render display math correctly (needs .katex-display class)
‚ùå should render multiple display math expressions
‚ùå should handle display math with complex expressions
‚ùå should handle display math with matrices (KaTeX parse error)
```

## üö® Critical Issues Discovered

### Issue 1: Duplicate Question IDs

**Error:**

```
Error: Encountered two children with the same key, `ch_iterative_bigo_2_q9`.
Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.
```

**Impact:**

- React reconciliation errors causing unpredictable UI behavior
- Questions may be duplicated or omitted from rendering
- Console flooding with error messages

**Root Cause:**

- Quiz data contains duplicate question IDs
- `AccessibleQuestionGrid.tsx` line 184 uses questionId as React key
- No validation during import to check for unique IDs

**Fix Required:**

1. Add ID uniqueness validation to quiz import
2. Scan and fix existing quiz files with duplicates
3. Implement automatic deduplication (append `-1`, `-2` suffixes)
4. Use composite keys in React: `${chapterId}-${questionId}-${index}`

### Issue 2: Incorrect Answer Feedback Not Showing

**Severity:** Critical (UX) - Users can't learn from mistakes!

**Problem:**
When selecting a wrong answer and clicking submit:

- ‚úÖ Correct answer shows in green
- ‚ùå User's incorrect selection does NOT show in red
- User can't see what they selected

**Expected:**

- Correct answer: Green background
- Wrong selection: Red background
- Both visible simultaneously

**Root Cause (Hypothesis):**

- Selection state (`selectedOptionId`) being cleared during submission
- UI only rendering `correctOptionIds` without preserving user's choice
- Related to state management issues in Section 2 of audit plan

**Fix Required:**

1. Preserve `selectedOptionId` after submission
2. Update `OptionCard` to show both correct AND selected states:
   ```tsx
   className={cn(
     isCorrect && 'bg-green-100 border-green-500',
     isSelected && !isCorrect && 'bg-red-100 border-red-500'
   )}
   ```
3. Add visual regression test
4. Add E2E test: "submit wrong answer -> verify red highlight"

**Priority:** Fix alongside Phase 2 (Answer Ledger Refactor)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Manual Verification Needed)

1. **Test inline math rendering:**
   - Load a quiz with inline math like `$O(n^2)$`
   - Verify no duplication
   - Verify proper styling

2. **Verify the duplicate ID error:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for the `ch_iterative_bigo_2_q9` error
   - Note which quiz file is causing it

3. **Test incorrect answer feedback:**
   - Select a wrong answer
   - Click submit
   - Check if your wrong selection shows in red

### Short-term (Fix Remaining Issues)

1. **Fix display math** (complete Phase 1)
   - Investigate why `$$...$$` doesn't generate `.katex-display` class
   - Fix matrix rendering KaTeX parse errors
   - Get remaining 9/13 tests passing

2. **Fix duplicate question IDs**
   - Add validation to quiz import
   - Scan and fix quiz data files
   - Implement deduplication strategy

3. **Fix incorrect answer feedback**
   - Preserve selectedOptionId after submission
   - Update OptionCard styling logic
   - Add tests

### Long-term (Continue Audit Plan)

- Phase 2: State Management (Answer Ledger Refactor)
- Phase 3: Import/Export
- Phase 4: Structural Refactor
- Phase 5: UI/UX Polish

## How to Verify

### Test Inline Math (Should Work ‚úÖ)

1. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Load a quiz with inline math
3. Look for expressions like `$O(n^2)$` or `$x = y$`
4. Verify they render as styled math (not duplicated text)

### Check Console Errors (Will Show Issues ‚ùå)

1. Open browser DevTools console
2. Load quiz
3. Look for duplicate key errors: `ch_iterative_bigo_2_q9`

### Test Wrong Answer Feedback (Will Show Issue ‚ùå)

1. Start a quiz
2. Select a wrong answer
3. Click Submit
4. Check if your selection shows in red (it won't - this is the bug)

**Status:** Partial fix complete. Ready for manual verification and next phase.
